# Questionnaire

## Part 1:	Programming Experience

*See Questionnaire on Programming Experience.*

## Part 2:	Programming Process

I'd like to ask you to tell me about a recent project of yours. It can be finished or still in progress, from work or a private project. Just walk me through it from start to end.	

*What kind of project was that?*

*How did you proceed?*

*What did you do before/after programming?*

*Were there any special cirsumstances that made the project more challenging than usual?*

*Have there been any other problems in the process?*

*Were these problems common in other projects as well?*

Is the process you just described comparable to your other projects?

Do you also program in private? If yes, is the process different?

Who do you write the project for? Who do you think of when programming?


## Part 3:	Blocks

Have you ever discontinued a project? Why?

Have there been projects that have been delayed significantly or where deadlines were not reached, even though the outside circumstances were not especially problematic?

Have there been moments where you were just stuck on a project, even though there were no special circumstances impeding the process?

*What were the problems that lead to that?*

*How annoying did you find those problems?*

*How did you address the problems?*

*Do you think you've ever had programmer's block?*


Do you want to add anything else?
